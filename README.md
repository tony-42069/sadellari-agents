# Sadellari Agents

An advanced AI agent framework powering Sadellari Enterprises' C-suite executive team. The system enables autonomous decision-making and collaboration between AI executives through Slack integration.

## Vision

Sadellari Agents is designed to create a self-governing executive team that can manage day-to-day operations of a holding company with minimal human intervention. By implementing specialized AI agents for different executive functions, the system distributes responsibilities while maintaining unified strategic direction.

Each agent has specific domain expertise and responsibilities:
- **CEO Agent:** Strategic decision-making, overall direction, and final authority
- **CFO Agent:** Financial oversight, budget management, treasury operations, and financial reporting
- **CTO Agent:** Technical architecture, technology stack decisions, and implementation oversight
- **CLO Agent:** Legal compliance, risk management, and regulatory adherence

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Decision-Making:** Agents can make decisions within their domains without human intervention
- **Real-time Slack Communication:** Natural language interface via Slack for both human-to-agent and agent-to-agent communication
- **Inter-agent Messaging System:** Structured protocol for agents to request information and services from each other
- **Decision-making Pipelines:** Formalized workflows for complex decisions requiring multi-agent input
- **Event-driven Architecture:** Responsive system that reacts to external events and internal state changes
- **Robust Error Handling:** Fallback mechanisms and error recovery to ensure system resilience

## Technical Stack

- **TypeScript:** Strongly-typed implementation for reliability and maintainability
- **Slack Bolt Framework:** Robust Slack API integration
- **Node.js:** Scalable runtime environment
- **Event-driven Architecture:** Message-based communication between components
- **Modular Design Pattern:** Extensible structure for adding new agents and capabilities
